# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 

Reference to course could be find [here](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-010/)

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit:

* a tidy data set as described below
* a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
* a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up 
the data called CodeBook.md. 
* You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 
* This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

## Documentation

To check more details, about process and variables, you could check the file [CodeBook.md](CodeBook.md) included in this folder of the repository.

Script file is named [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) included also in the same folder of the repository.
